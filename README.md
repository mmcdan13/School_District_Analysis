# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis project

I have performed analysis on the student funding, school performance, and grades on standardized testing in order to help the school board make decisions regarding school budgets and priorities. However, there seems to be evidence of academic dishonesty in the school reporting for Thomas High School ninth graders. The school board want sto uphold state-testing standards so I have been asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once replaced, I will repeat the school district analysis that I did describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.


## Results


- How is the district summary affected?

Replacing Thomas High School ninth graders' scores with NaN didn't impact district analysis much. Percentages didn't change more than 0.5 percentage points per category. Categories consists of average math and reading scores as well as percent passing math, reading, and both (overall).


- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

The ranking of the top schools were not affected by the update. Thomas High School remained in the top two schools. 


- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type
